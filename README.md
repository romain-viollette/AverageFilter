AverageFilter is a C++ library that compute the average of a set of data stored in a buffer. 
AverageFilter can be used with the included library CircularBuffer to store and manage the data.

Each library (AverageFilter & CircularBuffer) come with a makefile and a test program in order to prove the good behaviour and give an example of usage.

Those libraries are not licenced yet. If you use them, please send me a mail if you discover errors or have some remarks. 

The makefiles was created to work on Windows 7 with MinGW. With minor changes, they could be used on every other OS.
